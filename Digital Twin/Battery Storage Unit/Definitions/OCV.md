Open-Circuit Voltage ( OCV ) is used to estimate State of Charge ([[SOC]])


**Step 1: OCV vs SOC â€“ Open-Circuit Voltage Measurement**

#### ðŸ§ª **Procedure:**

1. Fully **charge** the battery.
    
2. Discharge it in **small steps** (e.g., 2% of total capacity).
    
3. After each step, **rest the battery** for 30â€“60 minutes (or until voltage stabilizes).
    
4. Record the **resting voltage** and calculate SOC based on discharged capacity.
    

|Step|Measurement|
|---|---|
|1|SOC = 1.00, V_OC = 4.2 V|
|2|SOC = 0.98, V_OC = 4.15 V|
|...|...|
|N|SOC = 0.00, V_OC = 3.0 V|

> ðŸ’¡ Plot these values to get the **OCV-SOC curve**.

This figure shows the changes in battery capacity (or SoC) vs voltage for different temperature. The battery should not operate at low temperature or high temperature.

* In low temperature, the battery capacity is small. 
* In high temperature, the battery capacity is high but that make the battery degrade much faster.
The following  figure shows show the resistance increase much faster with time in high temperature, which lead to increase in the battery degradation.

In general, this image illustrate the different in capacity and battery life for different temperature.

This equation illustrate the two main heat generation in a battery. First, the heat generated from the battery. Second, entropy heat during charge or discharge.

There are three ways to create a thermal Model:
- [[1D Thermal Model]]
- [[2D Thermal Model ]]
- [[3D Thermal Model]]

This model explain the electrochemical behavior of a battery cell. 
It is called as Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) or P2D model. 

* It is a high fidelity model but heavy and required a lot of computational time. 
* The of the DFN model are: Cell Voltage, Concentration profiles, Overpotentials, Reaction currents, SoC, Degradation behavior.

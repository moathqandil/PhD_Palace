The **Equivalent Series Model (ESM)** is a simplified electrical representation of a battery.

$V_{\text{terminal}} = V_{\text{OC}} - I \cdot R_s$

[[OCV]] is the open circuit voltage.

$R_s$ is the internal series resistance of the battery.
- Represents all **ohmic losses** inside the battery:
    - Electrolyte resistance
    - Contact resistance
    - Current collector resistance
- Typically **depends on**:
    - **[[SOC]]** (low at mid-SOC, high at low/high SOC)
    - **Temperature** (higher resistance at low temp)
    - **Battery aging** (resistance increases with degradation)

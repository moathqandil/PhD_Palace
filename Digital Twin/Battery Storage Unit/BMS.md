Battery Management System (BMS) is the brain of the lithium battery [[Battery Cell]], [[Battery Module]], or [[Battery Pack]].

The main task of a battery management system (BMS) is to monitor and control the battery system components, such as:
* Over and under voltage.
* Safe Temperature.
* Control cell balancing.
* Estimate inner battery's states: SOC & SOH.
